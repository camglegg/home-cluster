# On Pi need the --classic flag for isntall
# Nevermind... Might not work:
This revision of snap "microstack" was published using classic confinement and thus
       may perform arbitrary system changes outside of the security sandbox that snaps are
       usually confined to, which may put your system at risk.

       If you understand and want to proceed repeat the command including --classic.
